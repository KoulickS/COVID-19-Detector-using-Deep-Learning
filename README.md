COVID-19 is the deadliest disease right now around the around. It has killed more than 10,000 people around the world, the most affected being Italy and China.
In this model, I have used Chest X-ray Images as my dataset to detect COVID-19 in patients and accordingly label them as COVID-Positive and COVID-Negative. 
Technologies used: Keras, Tensorflow, Deep Learning
How does this work?
COVID-19 attacks epithelial cell that line our respiratory tract. So we can detect COVID-19 using the CXR's and determine the condition of the patient's lungs.
The overall accuracy of this model is 92.055%
